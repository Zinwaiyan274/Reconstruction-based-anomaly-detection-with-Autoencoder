# Reconstruction-based-anomaly-detection-with-Autoencoder



### Reconstruction-based anomaly detection with encoders can be applied in a variety of real-world scenarios, including:

Fraud detection: This can be used to detect fraudulent transactions in financial data. For example, an encoder can be trained on a set of normal transactions, and it can be used to detect transactions that have a high reconstruction error.
Network security: This can be used to detect intrusions in network traffic. For example, an encoder can be trained on a set of normal network traffic, and it can be used to detect traffic that has a high reconstruction error.
Medical diagnosis: This can be used to detect medical anomalies in medical data. For example, an encoder can be trained on a set of normal medical images, and it can be used to detect images that have a high reconstruction error.
Industrial manufacturing: This can be used to detect manufacturing anomalies in industrial data. For example, an encoder can be trained on a set of normal sensor readings, and it can be used to detect readings that have a high reconstruction error.
These are just a few examples of how reconstruction-based anomaly detection with encoders can be applied in the real world. As the technology continues to develop, it is likely that we will see even more applications for this powerful technique.

Here are some additional details about how reconstruction-based anomaly detection with encoders can be applied in each of these scenarios:

* Fraud detection: In fraud detection, an encoder can be trained on a set of normal transactions. When a new transaction is submitted, the encoder can be used to *  * * * *  * reconstruct the transaction. If the reconstruction error is high, then the transaction is likely to be fraudulent.
* Network security: In network security, an encoder can be trained on a set of normal network traffic. When new network traffic is detected, the encoder can be used to reconstruct the traffic. If the reconstruction error is high, then the traffic is likely to be malicious.
* Medical diagnosis: In medical diagnosis, an encoder can be trained on a set of normal medical images. When a new medical image is acquired, the encoder can be used to reconstruct the image. If the reconstruction error is high, then the image may contain a medical anomaly.
*Industrial manufacturing: In industrial manufacturing, an encoder can be trained on a set of normal sensor readings. When new sensor readings are collected, the encoder can be used to reconstruct the readings. If the reconstruction error is high, then the readings may indicate a manufacturing anomaly.
By detecting anomalies in data, reconstruction-based anomaly detection with encoders can help to prevent fraud, protect networks, improve medical diagnosis, and improve industrial manufacturing.




## How Reconstruction-based-anomaly-detection-with-Autoencoder works?



Reconstruction-based anomaly detection with encoders is a technique for detecting anomalies in data by comparing the reconstruction error of normal data to the reconstruction error of anomalous data.

An encoder is a type of neural network that learns to represent data in a lower-dimensional space. This lower-dimensional space is called the latent space. The encoder is trained on a set of normal data, and it learns to represent the normal data in a way that minimizes the reconstruction error.

When an encoder is presented with anomalous data, it will typically produce a reconstruction that has a higher reconstruction error than the reconstruction of normal data. This is because the encoder has not been trained on anomalous data, and it does not know how to represent it in the latent space.

The reconstruction error can be used to create an anomaly score. Anomaly scores can then be used to identify data points that are likely to be anomalous.

Reconstruction-based anomaly detection with encoders is a relatively new technique, but it has shown promising results on a variety of data sets.

Here are some of the advantages of reconstruction-based anomaly detection with encoders:

It is a non-parametric method, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data.
It is a scalable method, which means that it can be used to process large datasets.
It is a robust method, which means that it is not sensitive to noise in the data.
Here are some of the disadvantages of reconstruction-based anomaly detection with encoders:

It can be computationally expensive to train the encoder.
It can be difficult to find the right hyperparameters for the encoder.
It can be difficult to interpret the results of the anomaly detection algorithm.
Overall, reconstruction-based anomaly detection with encoders is a promising technique for detecting anomalies in data. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations before using it in a production setting.
